# Trip-duration-prediction-DataScience

Hello Everyone,

My teammate, Hinal Patel, and I collaborated on this project aimed at predicting trip durations for New York City cab rides. 
We believe that by understanding the time required for various tasks throughout the day, 
individuals can manage their time more effectively, enabling better planning and reducing chaos. 

Language and Models Employed:

.Efficiently developed and implemented machine learning models using Python and TensorFlow, 
 including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest, and XGBoost, 
 to predict trip durations on training and testing datasets.
.Evaluated model performance through diverse metrics including MSE, RMSE, and F1-Score, 
 while conducting comparisons between models with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
.Visualized these metrics using the Matplotlib library.

Setup:
To execute this application, clone the project and open it in the Jupyter Notebook. 
Make sure to correctly map the dataset, which has been sourced from Kaggle.

Thank You,
Vidyavathi Puli
